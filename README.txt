Name: Ringputer

Description: You find Dilbert's ring computer. Now, all you have to do is
figure out how to read the darn thing.

How to Solve: First, break out the GIF into frames. Then, set up a grid which
only highlights the character in the central image. Next, use either a 
histogramming method to identify the difference between a whole zero, one
or part of either to parse for numbers, or run the well-defined numbers
through an OCR. Once the numbers are extracted, convert them into characters
(via 8-bit ASCII) to get the flag.

What to disttribute:

dist/ring_computer.gif - The Dilbert strip which this challenge is styled
	after
